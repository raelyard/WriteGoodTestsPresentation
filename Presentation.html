# Why do we want to test?

- How do you know it works?
- You're going to test anyway
- Manual testing is costly
- Manual testing is especially costly with ASP.NET (not Core)
- Manual testing is boring (and therefore hard to do thoroughly and completely on a consistent basis)
- Don't be a "professional debuggerer" (don't be slow)
- Confidence

# What are good tests?

- Tests that aren't bad

# What are good tests?

- Tests that aren't bad
- Tests that express intent
- Documentation of intent
- Tests that have only one way to fail
- Tests that are independent and autonomous
- Tests that actually test something
- Tests that are easy to read
- Tests that are easy to maintain
- Tests that are fast (enough)
- Tests that do not have (too many) dependencies

# Second Class Citizens

```C#
public class When_Adding_Two_Numbers
{
    [Fact]
    public void Should_Result_Four()
    {
        Add(2, 2).ShouldEqual(4);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Should_Result_Five()
    {
        Add(2, 3).ShouldEqual(5);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Should_Result_Six()
    {
        Add(3, 3).ShouldEqual(6);
    }
}
```

# The Free Ride/Piggyback

```C#
public class When_Borrowing_Book
{
  [Fact]
  public void Should_Have_New_Loan()
  {
      var loan = BorrowBook(666);

      loan.Book.Title.ShouldEqual(
        "Harry Potter and Goblet of Fire",
        "Did not get the expected book title checked out.");
      loan.DueDate.ShouldEqual(
        DateTime.Parse("2017-03-01",
        "Did not get the expected due date on the loan."));
  }
}
```

# Happy Path

![happy](happy.jpg)

# The Liar

```C#
public class When_Adding_Two_Numbers
{
    [Fact]
    public void Should_Result_Five()
    {
        Add(2, 2).ShouldEqual(5);
    }
}
```

---
# The Local Hero
```C#
public class When_Presenting_Application_Name
{
    [Fact]
    public void Should_IncorporateMachineName()
    {
        new Application().Name.ShouldEqual(
          $"Super Awesome App On {System.Environment.MachineName}",
          "Presented the wrong application name");
    }
}
```

# Chain Gang

```C#
public class When_Performing_Banking_Transactions
{
    private readonly BankAccount _bankAccount;

    public When_Performing_Banking_Transactions()
    {
        _bankAccount = new BankAccount(100);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Deposit_Should_Increase_Balance()
    {
        _bankAccount.Deposit(20);
        _bankAccount.Balance.ShouldEqual(120);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Withdrawal_Should_Decrease_Balance()
    {
        _bankAccount.Withdraw(20);
        _bankAccount.Balance.ShouldEqual(100);
    }
}
```

---
# The Mockery

```C#
public class When_Doing_Something_With_Lots_Of_Dependencies
{
    [Fact]
    public void Should_Do_Something_Useful_After_Setting_Up_Dependencies()
    {
        // Heavy setup burden:
        var mockDependency0 = MockRepository.GenerateStub<IDependency0>();
        var mockDependency1 = MockRepository.GenerateStub<IDependency1>();
        var mockDependency2 = MockRepository.GenerateStub<IDependency2>();

        var instanceUnderTest =
          new ClassUnderTest(mockDependency0, mockDependency1, mockDependency2);

        // TODO: create a more useful assert:
        instanceUnderTest.UsefulFunctionality().ShouldEqual(0);
    }
}
```

# Smells:

- Tests that Can't Fail
- Multple Asserts
- Inordinate Setup
- Trivia

# Enough Bad Tests:
